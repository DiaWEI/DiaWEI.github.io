Dia Wei is now a PhD student at the School of Journalism and Communication at Nanjing University, majoring in journalism and communication, and is currently interested in cultural communication and arts communication. Prior to pursuing her PhD, Wei received a Master of Arts degree from City University of Hong Kong and a Bachelor of Arts degree from Central South University.

During the Master's program, Wei majored in Creative Media, focusing on media culture and arts planning. While studying media theory, she followed her tutor to visit major art galleries and museums in Hong Kong to compare their theme selection, curatorial logic and mode of operation, and assisted her tutor in organizing the successful "Utopia, Dystopia, Nature" art exhibition as a curatorial assistant.

Wei completed her undergraduate studies in Digital Publishing at the College of Humanities, Central South University. During this period, Wei not only completed theoretical studies, but also participated in a number of research activities, and independently completed the "Study on Chinese Fireworks Branding", which provided a reference for Hunan fireworks companies to develop their branding plans.
